##  Outline

TODO
- Run through deck tonight
- Feel out what to trim
- Add App sketches

0. Intro
 - The app we built, general problem space overview
 - Speed tests & development over Backbone aka Why Angular?
 - Not experts, just been working with it awhile
 - Getting Started: Toolchains etc

1. The Learning Process
 - Breaking away from JQuery view of the world
 - Starting with lots of controllers
 - Lots of $emit, $broadcast, $on, and $watch
 - Transition to Services
 - Demystifying scopes
 - scopes and objects copy by val vs ref
 - When to use a directive (I'm still not sure?)
 - Learning too much at once (Jasmine, Coffee, Grunt, SASS, & Angular a bit much)

2. The Journey # TODO May need better title
 - Angular Version upgrades along the way, how to keep up
 - Node dependency management (grunt bower setting up CI build servers)
 - UI Router
 - UI Bootstrap
 - Developing consistent testing strategies
 - Finding best practices for file organization, modules, naming conventions etc
 - NG-Conf (worth mentioning?)
 - Restangular / a note about APIs

3. Polishing up: the gotchas
 - Lifecycle of services and when to keep data in them vs direct to a controller
 - Nested states in UIRouter
 - Roles and permissions in a SPA
 - GulpJS file handler issues (maybe)
 - E2E Testing: why we haven't (yet)

4. Any parting words?
 - High praise for Restangular, UIRouter, UIBootstrap, Karma/Jasmine (anything else?)
 - Keep an eye out for whats coming / what others are having success with
 - IE support (Angular 2 is dropping 8)
 - Be consistent (took us awhile to get there)
 - Dont let refactor be a dirty word to business
