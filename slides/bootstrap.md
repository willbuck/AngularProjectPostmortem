## ui bootstrap

- yeah, get rid of jquery
- bootstrap upgrade from 2.x to 3.x, lag on ui.bootstrap to upgrade
- angularStrap updated right away. ui.bootstrap team took forever.
- blocked us from upgrading to use the bootstrap 3.0 css

note:
    you will never get rid of jquery, too many libraries require it: image uploader, scrollSpy, etc...
    thought of rolling our own, but consistency of the code was too big of a tradeoff
