## Unlearning JQuery Mindsets
- Angular is more framework than library
- Angular is more declarative than imperative
- Two-way data binding vs manual DOM management
- Dependency Injection & modularity vs. $.ready()
- Design your models first, not your page
- Having Backbone knowledge was helpful here

note:
	- Declarative: what you want to do, imperative is how you want it done
	- Binding: if you have any code doing this explicitly then you are doing it wrong
	- Models: Jquery mindset is to design the page then manipulate the dom. Angular is to think about your data first.
	- Backbone: helped us to think in terms of modules, separation of concern, single responsibility, & templates
