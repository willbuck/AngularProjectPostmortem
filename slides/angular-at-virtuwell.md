##  Angular at Virtuwell

- Started in 2012 building a Backbone app
- Ended up with a lot of code & inconsistent 2-way binding
- Chose AngularJS for our next big project
- Team fell in love
- Re-wrote much of Backbone app in Angular in short matter of months

note:
    - Remind people what VW does
    - Slide says most of it
