## ui bootstrap

- Lets get rid of JQuery, Yeah! (HAHAHA As if you can...)
- bootstrap upgrade from 2.x to 3.x, lag on ui-bootstrap to upgrade
- angularStrap updated right away. ui.bootstrap team took forever.
- blocked us from upgrading to use the bootstrap 3.0 css

note:
- You will never get rid of jquery, too many libraries require it:
- image uploader, scrollSpy, etc...
- ui-bootstrap: Thought of rolling our own, but consistency of the code was too big of a tradeoff
