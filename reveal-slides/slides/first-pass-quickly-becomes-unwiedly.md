##  First Pass: quickly becomes unwieldy

- Avoid "scope soup"
- controllerAs syntax helps
- Share data in a .factory (or .value perhaps)
- Magic controller inheritance makes very odd-looking code
- If you're going to do it, at least give it some structure

note:
- There are dangers of sharing in a .factory though
