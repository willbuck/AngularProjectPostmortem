For us, this was

- [Angular-UI](https://angular-ui.github.io/) ([Router](https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) & [Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/))
- [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to get started
- A bit of [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
- TDD Unit Tests w/ [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)
- Git & [gitflow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- "Use what works" & "just ship it"

note:
    - May not need underscore, perhaps should be using lodash
    - Note on TDD: I like it, we have 324ish unit tests, helps me write my code
    - Some may say just write targeted E2E tests, I think there's value in both
    - "Just Ship It", is that Nike+'s motto?
