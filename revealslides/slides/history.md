## A little History

 - Replacement to current and original application
 - We learned something about the domain model
 - Only need to support 1 browser (firefox)
 - Minimal users of the application

 notes:
 	- messy, 2000 plus lines of js, using various jquery libraries. put together without any thought. not testable
 	- twerked the domain model to accomidate the use cases for the application
 	- can take advantage of the new features of firefox. (web-sockets, local storage) 
 	- total users of the system at any given time can be counted on 1 hand
