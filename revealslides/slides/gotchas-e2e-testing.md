## Maybe still need E2E Testing?

- Best when you have a good handle on how things will be used
- That came late for us, we'd benefit from some now though
- Protractor is pretty awesome though [@ramonvictor's slides on why](https://ramonvictor.github.io/protractor/slides/#/)

note:
    - Data setup is tough for us, would need to mock out endpoints
    - Seriously though protractor is awesome
