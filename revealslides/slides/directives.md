## Directives

- Directives everywhere with no understanding of scope (show picture of drunk idiot kids at house party)
- Rule of thumb: only use for manipulating DOM
- no need for JQuery
- the birth of web components


notes:
	- remembering where you wrote your first directive is like remembering where you lost your virginity, or the first time you got drunk
	- doubleclick - the size of your project depended upon how many directives you used. This is bad.
	- read ng-book on directives, understanding of directive lifecycles
	- you will make the mistake of not isolating your scope and pay a price
