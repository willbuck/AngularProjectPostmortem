##  Use Tools / Libraries / Strategies you find useful

For us, this was

- Angular-UI (Router & Bootstrap)
- Restangular
- Yeoman to get started
- A bit of [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) and [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
- TDD Unit Tests
- Git & [gitflow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
- "Use what works" & "just ship it"

note:
    - May not need underscore, perhaps should be using lodash
    - "Just Ship It", is that Nike+'s motto?
