## Routes

- Started with $route
- Quickly moved to $state with angular-ui-router
- show code example of app.coffee
- show example of named route call?

notes:
	- $route only allows you to assign controllers and template to a url, not very flexible
	- $state, allows for nested views, resolves, and named routes
