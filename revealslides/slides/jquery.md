## Angular view vs Jquery view of the world
- Having Backbone knowledge was extremely helpful
- Unlearning JQuery view of the world
- Jquery is a Library not a Framework
- Angular is declaritive rather than imperative
- two way data binding
- Dependency Injection
- Data Access
- design your models first, not your page


note:
	- this provided us with an base understanding of some great concepts like data-binding, and scope
		Also, provided us with the knowledge to know what to look for(validation, dom manipulation, templates)
	- You call Jquery to do something vs Angular calling you when it needs to
	- This was one of the hard ones to except, you tend to not believe that this really works.
		if you have any code doing this explicitly then you are doing it wrong
	- This is usually the one that comes later. mostly because all the tutorials don't do it. This is really nice.
	- jquery doesn't deal with this. Angular does with: routing, $resource, binding is simple and easy to test
	- Jquery mindset is to design the page then use jquery to manipulate the dom. Angular is to think about your data first.
