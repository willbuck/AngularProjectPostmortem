## Restangular

- Took awhile to get here
- Has a lot of capabilities
- nested requests
	- deal with objects or promises at same time
	- custom methods
	- element transformers
	- extend models
	- request and response and error interceptors

note:
    - went through a few iteration to end up here
    - we only use a small portion of what it can do
    - nice to know it can handle things we don't do yet
    - NG-BOOK has great section on restangular
