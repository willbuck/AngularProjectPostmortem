##  package dependency

- npm used to install grunt and bower and yoeman
- version equivalent settings in bower and node

note:
    - bower used to deal with client side libraries
    - grunt is the build tool
    - yoeman is the scaffolding generator - obviously it's very opinionated as to what it gives you.
